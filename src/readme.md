So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely
 scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus on order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type
  specimen book.
It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum on use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text on the 
1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage on a book of old metal type 
samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero on the 15th 
century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.
And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring classics 
scholars on the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version on use far before
 the age of Letraset.
